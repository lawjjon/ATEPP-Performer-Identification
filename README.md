# ATEPP-Performer-Identification

Using machine learning techniques to identify piano performers from the ATEPP dataset.

The Jupyter Notebook [ATEPP_Audio.ipynb](https://github.com/lawjjon/ATEPP-Performer-Identification/blob/main/ATEPP_Audio.ipynb) contains the code used to process the data and run the models for performer identification.

**Note:** _This repository, alongside [Mazurka-Performer-Identification](https://github.com/lawjjon/Mazurka-Performer-Identification), are the appendices for my dissertation on piano performer identification. The code is for demonstration purposes only and cannot be run without access to the original audio recordings_.
